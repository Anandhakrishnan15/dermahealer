      Hair fall emerges as a leading concern among adults in Bihar. 
      Factors like hard water, urban stress, and dietary gaps contribute significantly to this distressing problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Scientific Insights & Causes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nutritional Deficiencies:</strong> Indian studies highlight amino acid and micronutrient shortages—histidine, leucine, valine, alanine, and cysteine—across different types of alopecia. Iron, zinc, and copper deficiencies are also notable.</li>
      <li><strong>Broader Micronutrient Role:</strong> Nutrients are vital in managing inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormonal modulation—key factors in hair loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Mineral Deficiency Effects:</strong> Zinc deficiency contributes to alopecia and delayed wound healing.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Causes:</strong> Illnesses, thyroid disorders, anemia, and chronic conditions may trigger diffuse hair fall like telogen effluvium.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solutions for Stronger Hair in Bihar</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Rich in proteins, iron, zinc, and essential amino acids.</li>

    <p>
      Acne isn’t just a teenage nuisance—it’s a chronic inflammatory condition 
      affecting over 85% of adolescents worldwide and up to two-thirds of adults. 
      In Bihar’s hot, humid climate, pore-clogging and bacterial growth can amplify acne, 
      impacting confidence during critical exam years and college life.
    </p>

    <h2>Scientific Insights & Causes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Global Prevalence:</strong> Acne affects around 20.5% globally, peaking at 28.3% among youth aged 16–24. In India, a study reported an 87% prevalence, with 85.1% experiencing mild acne and the remainder moderate to severe.</li>
      <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Research shows acne often continues into adulthood—73.2% from adolescence, and even 82% in some studies.</li>
      <li><strong>Dietary Factors:</strong> High-glycemic diets and dairy have been associated with acne exacerbation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Myths vs Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>“Oily food is the main cause.”</em><br/>
      <strong>Fact:</strong> While diet can influence acne, hormonal changes and skin bacteria (Cutibacterium acnes) are primary drivers.</li>
      <li><em>“It will go away on its own.”</em><br/>
      <strong>Fact:</strong> Many keep experiencing acne into adulthood—see above statistics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Treatments for Bihar’s Climate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gentle, twice-daily cleansing to remove excess sebum.</li>
      <li>Avoid harsh home remedies—they can disrupt skin barrier and worsen inflammation.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional options at Derma Healer:</strong> Chemical peels, laser therapy, and tailored medications ensure long-term results.</li>
      <li><strong>Sun protection:</strong> Use non-comedogenic sunscreen daily, especially under Bihar’s strong sunlight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Teenage acne is widespread—but treatable. Don’t buy into myths.
